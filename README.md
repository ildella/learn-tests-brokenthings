# Learn, Test, and Broken Things

This is the repository for all the code I write to learn.

* mostly Javascript (Node.js, ES6+)
* Some ReactJW
* All tests + linters + code coverage tools
* DevOps code (aka: Infrastructure Code). Or bash :)

## Content
What I do commit to push here (see what I did here?):

* Learning. Good and bad solution I learn and I want to freeze for future reference
* Broken stuff. Some code that does not work and I want to share for comfort. 
* Tests. A good test is the best thing to learn, to test something works and freeze something that do work. 

## Why this name
It's inspired by an episode of Game of Thrones, the TV Series, titled [Cripple, Bastards, and Broken Things](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cripples,_Bastards,_and_Broken_Things)
The reason is that today, March 16th 2018, I decided to create this mostly as the repo for broken things that I want to share with other people, including myself in the future, to remember the good times spent fixing things and learning stuff.

## What you can find

I am adding code when I have time with basic functionalities of different technologies. 
For example:

```bash
cd nodejs && npm install && node src/websocket-server.js
cd reactjs/tutorial-app && npm install && npm start
```

This will launch a simple WebSocket server built on socket.io and the ReactJS tutorial app with a SocketIO component that connects to the server and print a welcome message. 

There are also some interesting example with Nodejs streams, generators and highlandjs in the [Node](node) folder.

More to come...
