# Learn, Test, and Broken Things
This is my repository for all code I write to learn stuff. 
All the code is probably going to be Javascript as I almost esclusively use that language since 2015.

## Why this name
It's inspired by an episode of Game of Thrones, the TV Series, titled [Cripple, Bastards, and Broken Things](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cripples,_Bastards,_and_Broken_Things)
The reason is that today, March 16th 2018, I decided to create this mostly as the repo for broken things that I want to share with other people, including myself in the future, to remember the good times spent fixing things and learning stuff.

## Content
There will be three two kind of content: 
* Learning. Basic stuff I write as I learn, and I want to freeze for future reference
* Broken stuff. Some code that do not work... hopefully until I find and commit a solution, if any applicable. 

So why test in the title as well? 
Cause most code will be written in test form, and I commit to keep the project green.
