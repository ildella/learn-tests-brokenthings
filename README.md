# Learn, Test, and Broken Things
This is my repository for all code I write to learn stuff. 
The code will mostly be:
1. Javascript. NodeJS really
2. Maybe some React :)
3. Bash. Because it hurts.

## Content
What I do commit to push here (see what I did here?):

* Learning. Good and bad solution I learn and I want to freeze for future reference
* Broken stuff. Some code that does not work and I want to share for comfort. 
* Tests. A good test is the best thing to learn, to test something works and freeze something that do work. 

## Why this name
It's inspired by an episode of Game of Thrones, the TV Series, titled [Cripple, Bastards, and Broken Things](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cripples,_Bastards,_and_Broken_Things)
The reason is that today, March 16th 2018, I decided to create this mostly as the repo for broken things that I want to share with other people, including myself in the future, to remember the good times spent fixing things and learning stuff.
