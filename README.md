# Learn, Tests, and Broken Things

A personal repo where I collect sample code for different use cases and techonlogies

* The language is Javascript (ES6+). Mostly Node.js, some React
* Tests and code I use to learn libraries and tools
* My best practices for tests, linters, code coverage, continuous integrations.
* DevOps (aka: Infrastructure Code).
* Various stuff I like to share, like my bash aliases and some bash scripts I find useful
* Articles / Guides / How Tos... (coming soon...)

## Highligths

### Websocket Server + React

```bash
cd nodejs && npm install && node src/websocket-server.js
cd reactjs/tutorial-app && npm install && npm start
```

This will launch a simple WebSocket server built on socket.io and the ReactJS tutorial app with a SocketIO component that connects to the server and print a welcome message. 

There are also some interesting example with Nodejs streams, generators and highlandjs in the [Node.js](nodejs) folder.

More to come...

## Why this name
It's inspired by an episode of Game of Thrones, the TV Series, titled [Cripple, Bastards, and Broken Things](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cripples,_Bastards,_and_Broken_Things)
The reason is that today, March 16th 2018, I decided to create this mostly as the repo for broken things that I want to share with other people, especially myself in the future, to remember the good times spent fixing code and learning things.
